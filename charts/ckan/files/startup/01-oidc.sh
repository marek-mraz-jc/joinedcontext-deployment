# Point ckanext-oidc-pkce at this cluster's realm, after the entrypoint has written the ini.
#
# The extension reads its base URL, client id and client secret straight from the environment
# (`os.environ.get` in its `config.py`), but every path it appends to them — authorize, token,
# userinfo, logout — it reads through `tk.config`, and its defaults are Okta's paths. Against
# Keycloak a login would ask for `/oauth2/default/v1/authorize` and get a 404.
#
# So they are written into $CKAN_INI here, under the names the extension looks up, rather than
# left to the `envvars` plugin's `CKAN___` spelling: one option, one name, in the file the rest
# of this chart's configuration already lives in.
#
# Sourced by `start_ckan.sh`, not executed — so no `exit` on the path where there is nothing to
# do, or the entrypoint would stop before uWSGI (see 00-secret-key.sh for the order).
