# Registers of the Banská Bystrica region

<!-- Generated from the LinkML source by Model Tools. Do not edit: `jcctl model

What the region's register space carries side by side (DM-01, DM-61): the outlines of its 13 districts and 516 municipalities, the organisations the region founded, the hospitals, the social services run by public bodies, and the bridges of the road network, each read from the region's own open-data portal (opendata.bbsk.sk). One model, one space, one public endpoint. Where Smart Data Models has the class, its IRI is cited rather than minted (DM-04, DM-16).
