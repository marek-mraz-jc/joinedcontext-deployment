One public event as a town, a region or a cultural body announces it on its web site or feed: what it is, when it starts and ends, and where, as a GPS point. The class is schema.org's Event under the names Smart Data Models and schema.org use, so the space's iCalendar surface (RFC 5545, EP-125) reads it as published: `id` the UID, `name` the SUMMARY, `startDate` and `endDate` DTSTART and DTEND, `description`, `address`, `location` and `url` DESCRIPTION, LOCATION, GEO and URL, `organizer` ORGANIZER. An event without a name, a start or a link is refused by the pipeline and never reaches the space (owner 2026-10-20, 2026-10-22); its point and organizer are kept where known. One event announced by two sources is one entity: its id is `urn:ngsi-ld:Event:bbsk-podujatia:` followed by the first 16 hex digits of the SHA-256 of `name \| start \| lower(addressLocality)` (the name in lower case with only its letters and digits, the start to the hour in UTC or the day), so the second source overwrites the first rather than adding a copy.

## Classes

### Event

One public event: its name, its start and a link are required (owner 2026-10-22); its place as a GPS point is expected and filled from the source or the venue table, its organizer kept where the source names one, the rest kept where the source gives it.

IRI: `schema:Event`

Specialises `Entity`.

| Attribute | NGSI-LD kind | Range | Required | Unit | IRI | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | Property | `string` | yes |  | `schema:name` | The title of the event as the source writes it, in Slovak. |
| `startDate` | Property | `string` | yes |  | `schema:startDate` | When the event starts: an RFC 3339 instant with its offset (`2026-11-14T19:00:00+01:00`, Europe/Bratislava as the source publishes it), or a date alone (`2026-11-14`) for an event that lasts whole days. |
| `endDate` | Property | `string` |  |  | `schema:endDate` | When the event ends, written as `startDate`; for a whole-day event its last day, inclusive. Absent when the source gives no end: the calendar then shows the start alone. |
| `location` | GeoProperty | `string` |  |  | `geojson:geometry` | Where the event takes place, a GeoJSON Point in WGS 84 inside Slovakia (longitude 16.8 to 22.6, latitude 47.7 to 49.7): the source's own point, the venue's building, else the organizer's or the town's office or the town's centre, as `locationPrecision` says (owner 2026-10-21: at least 90 % of events with a point). |
| `locationPrecision` | Property | [`LocationPrecision`](#locationprecision) |  |  | `jc:locationPrecision` | How close `location` is to the venue: `source` the publisher's own point, `building` the venue's building (the address register or a venue checked against OpenStreetMap), `office` the organizer's or the town's office standing in for a venue nobody placed, `centre` the town's centre. A map draws `office` and `centre` as approximate. |
| `locationSource` | Property | `string` |  |  | `jc:locationSource` | Who placed `location`: `feed` the publisher, `register-adries`, `overpass`, `nominatim` or `hand` the venue table's row (seeds/bbsk-events/venues.csv), `towns` the town table's office or centre (T-5490). |
| `venue` | Property | `string` |  |  | `jc:venue` | The name of the place, as the source writes it (a hall, a square, a museum). |
| `refPointOfInterest` | Relationship | [`PointOfInterest`](#pointofinterest) |  |  | `sdm:refPointOfInterest` | The venue as a PointOfInterest of this space, when the venue table placed the event; every event held there links the same one (DM-141). |
| `areaServed` | Property | `string` |  |  | `sdm:areaServed` | The municipality the event or the venue belongs to, by its official name (`Detva`, `Košice`): the key a count or a filter per town reads, on every event (DM-141). |
| `address` | Property | [`PostalAddress`](#postaladdress) |  |  | `schema:address` | The postal address of the venue, field by field (Smart Data Models' common PostalAddress); `addressLocality` is the town a calendar filters on. A field the source leaves out is absent, never guessed. |
| `category` | Property | [`EventCategory`](#eventcategory) (list) |  |  | `sdm:category` | The event's main category, one code of the platform's list of 16 (docs API/12-event-categories.md), picked by the rule table seeds/event-categories.json from the source's own word, the name or the kind of body that announced it (`music`, `sport`), else by the decision model's cached answer (T-5490). A list of one, as Smart Data Models' Event writes `category`; absent while neither has named the event. |
| `eventCategory` | Property | `string` |  |  | `jc:eventCategory` | The kind of event in the source's own words (`koncert`, `výstava`, `šport`), kept so `category` can be traced back to it. |
| `audience` | Property | [`EventAudience`](#eventaudience) (list) |  |  | `sdm:audience` | Who the event is for, in Smart Data Models' Event codes; set with the category `children-family`, `children` when the source or the name says children, else `family`. |
| `categorySource` | Property | `string` |  |  | `jc:categorySource` | How `category` was picked: `rule` the rule table, `model` the decision model's cached answer for an event no rule decides (scripts/events-classify.py, T-5490). |
| `description` | Property | `string` |  |  | `schema:description` | What the source says about the event, as plain text without markup. |
| `organizer` | Property | [`Organizer`](#organizer) |  |  | `schema:organizer` | Who runs the event: the museum, the school, the town or the named performer, never the feed or the aggregator that announced it (that is `dataProvider`). Its name and its web site only, never a person's e-mail or phone. |
| `url` | Property | `uri` | yes |  | `schema:url` | An http(s) link a person opens: the page of the event at its source, where they read more or buy a ticket, else the organizer's page that lists its events. |
| `dataProvider` | Property | `string` |  |  | `sdm:dataProvider` | Who announced the event (the town, the region, the cultural body), as the credit names it. |
| `source` | Property | `uri` |  |  | `sdm:source` | The feed or the page the pipeline read the event from. |
| `sourceId` | Property | `string` |  |  | `jc:sourceId` | The event's own identifier at its source, so a record can be traced back. |
| `dateModified` | Property | `datetime` |  |  | `sdm:dateModified` | When the source last changed the record. |
| `id` | Property | `string` | yes |  | `ngsi-ld:hasId` | The entity id, urn:ngsi-ld:{Type}:{orgDomain}:{space}:{localId}. |
| `type` | Property | `string` | yes |  | `ngsi-ld:hasType` | The entity type, one class of a published data model. |
| `observedAt` | Property | `datetime` |  |  | `ngsi-ld:observedAt` | When the observation the entity reports was made. |
