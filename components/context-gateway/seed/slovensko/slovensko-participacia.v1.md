# Citizen participation in Slovakia

What a town publishes on its participation platform (Decidim): the participatory processes and assemblies, the proposals residents filed, the projects of a participatory budget, the results the town reports, the meetings, the debates and the surveys (T-5065). Each record is copied from the platform's public GraphQL API, or from its public pages where the API hides it, and carries the link back to its page. No personal data: author names, profiles, comments and their authors are never read, and e-mail addresses and phone numbers are cut from every text. An id is `urn:ngsi-ld:{Type}:slovensko-participacia:{instance}-{Decidim id}`, so a record keeps its entity from run to run; one no run has seen for three days leaves the space (expiresAt).
