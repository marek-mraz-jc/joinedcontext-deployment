# Open research of the University of Žilina

What the university's space carries (DM-01, DM-61): one entity per item of DREPO, the university's digital library, that carries an open licence of its own, described by its title, kind, year, collection and licence. Authors are people, so the model has no slot for them: an application counts and lists works, it does not list who wrote them. Sources: Research/zilina-open-data-sources.md.
