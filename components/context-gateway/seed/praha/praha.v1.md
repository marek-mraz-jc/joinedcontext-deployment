# Prague city data

<!-- Generated from the LinkML source by Model Tools. Do not edit: `jcctl model

What the Prague city space carries side by side (DM-01, DM-61): the nextbike docking stations and what they hold now, ČHMÚ's hourly air quality at the city's stations, the city districts, the schools, cultural venues, public toilets and sorted-waste points of the city's geoportal (IPR Praha), the park-and-ride car parks and how full they are now, the monitored sorted-waste containers and their fill level and the PID vehicles in service (Golemio), the PID ticket points, the parks, green areas and trees of the shared green register (IPR Praha), and the city budget line by line. One model, one space, one public endpoint. Where Smart Data Models has the class, its IRI is cited rather than minted (DM-04, DM-16).

### GreenAsset

One technical element of the city's shared green register (IPR Praha): a bench, a fence, a path, a paved area, a wall, a water feature or a tree pit, where it is, its kind, material and surface, its manager and care regime.
