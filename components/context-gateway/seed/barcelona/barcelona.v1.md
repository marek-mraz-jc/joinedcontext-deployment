# Barcelona, open data

What the space barcelona carries (DM-01, DM-61): the open data of Barcelona City Council (Open Data BCN) as Smart Data Models types, their IRIs cited rather than minted (DM-04, DM-16). The first type is AirQualityObserved, one entity per station of the city's air-quality network with the hourly mean of each pollutant it measures; each Open Data BCN batch adds its agendas (cultural, daily and sports); PointOfInterest the city's register of facilities (equipaments); each Open Data BCN batch adds its own classes. Transport: TrafficFlowObserved, the traffic state of each street section and each route of sections the city reports every five minutes, OnStreetParking, each regulated surface parking section (blue, green, loading and bus zones), and EVChargingStation, each public charging point of the Endolla Barcelona network with its live socket states, BikeLane, each segment of the bike network open or under construction, RoadAccident, each accident the Guàrdia Urbana handled, as counts only, and each traffic counter's monthly intensity as TrafficFlowObserved. Urbanism: the districts and barris as AdministrativeArea, the works on the public space as CityWork and the street inventory's crossings as PedestrianCrossing, its speed reducers as StreetFurniture and the drinking and ornamental fountains as PointOfInterest. Tourism: each licensed tourist flat (habitatge d'ús turístic) as TouristRental, at the building's address and point.
