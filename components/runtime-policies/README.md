# Runtime Kyverno policies

In-cluster Kyverno `ClusterPolicy` resources that enforce/report on things that
**only exist at runtime** — injected sidecars, namespace annotations applied by
the `prepare` hook, opt-out markers, dynamically created operator Pods. They are
shipped as the `runtime-policies` helmfile component (a small Helm chart under
`charts/runtime-policies/`). Because they are cluster-scoped `ClusterPolicy`
objects, they are created **once per cluster** — see [Deploy](#deploy).

## Pod Security Standards

Four of the policies — `drop-all-capabilities`, `require-ro-rootfs`,
`require-run-as-non-root-user` and `require-run-as-nonroot` — are not written
here. They are vendored verbatim from `github.com/kyverno/policies` into
`charts/runtime-policies/files/upstream/` by
`.ci/policies/vendor-upstream-policies.sh`, the same script and the same pinned
ref that fill `.ci/policies/base/`, so the manifests CI evaluates and the
manifests admission evaluates are the same file.

The template sets two things the vendored copy must not carry, because the copy
stays editable only by the vendor script: the per-rule `validate.failureAction`
(the vendored policies still use the deprecated `spec.validationFailureAction`),
and `match.resources.namespaces`. That last one is the scope, and it is
deliberate — the namespaces are supplied by the helmfile and are the ones this
deployment puts workloads in. Enforcing Pod Security Standards on the namespaces
the cluster distribution owns (`linkerd`, `traefik`, `cert-manager`,
`system-upgrade`) would block that distribution's own upgrades; Kyverno's global
`resourceFilters` already exclude `kube-system`, `kube-public`, `kube-node-lease`
and `kyverno`. With no namespaces, nothing is rendered at all: a `ClusterPolicy`
with no scope matches every namespace, so an empty list has to mean "off", never
"everywhere".

The capabilities policy is `drop-all-capabilities` rather than the stricter
`disallow-capabilities-strict` that CI applies to rendered manifests. The strict
policy also forbids *adding* capabilities, and Linkerd's `linkerd-init` adds
`NET_ADMIN` and `NET_RAW` to program the pod's iptables — at admission it would
reject every meshed pod on the cluster. Rendered manifests carry no init
container of that kind, which is why CI can hold the stricter line.

## Why separate from `.ci/policies/`

`.ci/policies/` is a *shift-left* scan: `kyverno apply` runs against the static
`helmfile template` output (see `.ci/policies/README.md`). That output does
**not** contain the `linkerd-proxy` sidecar — Linkerd injects it at admission
time via its mutating webhook — nor the namespace annotations set by the
`prepare` hook. A "require sidecar" check therefore cannot live in the
shift-left pipeline; it has to run against **live** cluster state.

These policies are evaluated by Kyverno *in the cluster*:

- **Admission** — new Pods/Namespaces are checked on create/update. Linkerd's
  mutating injector runs before Kyverno's validating webhook, so the proxy is
  already present when these policies evaluate.
- **Background** (`background: true`) — existing resources are re-scanned and
  surfaced as `PolicyReport` / `ClusterPolicyReport` objects.

## Prerequisite

Kyverno must be running **in the cluster** — this chart only ships the
`ClusterPolicy` objects, not Kyverno itself. Both the smoke-test CI and the local
`just deploy` bootstrap it via `.ci/kyverno/helmfile.yaml.gotmpl`
(`scripts/ci/install-kyverno-if-missing.sh`, idempotent). To install it
standalone — e.g. on a cluster you sync into manually — run:

```sh
just kyverno   # or: helmfile -f .ci/kyverno/helmfile.yaml.gotmpl sync
```

## Deploy

The policies are cluster-scoped `ClusterPolicy` objects with fixed names, so they
must exist **once per cluster** — never per instance (two releases would fight
over the same cluster-scoped resources). The component's helmfile therefore
renders the release only in the shared layers, gated by `deployLayer`:

- **Multi-instance clusters** — the release ships with the shared cluster
  operators (`deployment/helmfile-operators.yaml`, `deployLayer: operators`),
  deployed *once* via `just deploy-operators`. It is deliberately **skipped** in
  the per-instance layer (`helmfile-instance.yaml.gotmpl`, `deployLayer:
  instance`), so `just deploy-instance` does not touch it. The release lives in
  the shared operator namespace (`global.operators.namespace`, default
  `jc-operators`).
- **Legacy all-in-one** (`deployLayer: ""`, `helmfile -f ./deployment/ sync` /
  `just deploy`) — the release is rendered as before, into the instance
  namespace.

Two global knobs in `global.runtimePolicies` control it:

```yaml
global:
  runtimePolicies:
    enabled: true        # set the release's `installed:` flag
    failureAction: Audit # Audit (report only) or Enforce (block at admission)
```

The Linkerd policies additionally switch on automatically only when the Linkerd
service mesh is enabled (`global.serviceMesh.type: linkerd`).

Inspect what is being flagged:

```sh
kubectl get clusterpolicyreport,policyreport -A
kubectl describe clusterpolicyreport <name>
```

To deploy the raw policies outside helmfile (e.g. a GitOps controller or a quick
manual apply), render them through the chart first so the `failureAction`
placeholder is resolved — `kubectl apply` against the raw `files/` would apply
the literal `KYVERNO_FAILURE_ACTION` placeholder:

```sh
helm template ./charts/runtime-policies | kubectl apply -f -
```

## Enforcement level

Every policy ships with `validate.failureAction: Audit` — violations are
reported, nothing is blocked. Once a policy is clean in the reports, flip the
relevant rule to `Enforce` to block at admission.

> Caution with `Enforce` on `require-linkerd-sidecar`: if the Linkerd proxy
> injector is down, **no** Pod in a meshed namespace will admit. Keep it on
> `Audit` until injection is reliably healthy.

## Adding a policy

Drop a new `*.yaml` `ClusterPolicy` into `charts/runtime-policies/files/` and
reference it from the matching template so it is rendered into the release:

- `templates/linkerd-policies.yaml` (gated by `.Values.linkerd.enabled`), or
- `templates/operator-policies.yaml` (gated by `.Values.operators.enabled`).

Each template line wraps the file with the failure-action placeholder, e.g.:

```gotmpl
{{ .Files.Get "files/<policy>.yaml" | replace "KYVERNO_FAILURE_ACTION" .Values.failureAction }}
```

Conventions to keep the set consistent:

- Use `failureAction: KYVERNO_FAILURE_ACTION` (the template substitutes the
  configured value) rather than hard-coding `Audit`/`Enforce`.
- `background: true` so existing resources are scanned, not just new ones —
  unless the rule reads `request.userInfo` (admission-only → `background: false`).
- Fill in the `policies.kyverno.io/*` annotations (title, category, severity,
  subject, description) as the existing policies do.
- Validate before committing (see below).

## Validate locally

The `files/` policies carry the literal `KYVERNO_FAILURE_ACTION` placeholder, so
render them through the chart first (or substitute the placeholder) before
feeding them to the `kyverno` CLI:

```sh
helm template ./charts/runtime-policies --show-only templates/operator-policies.yaml > /tmp/policies.yaml

# offline: works for policies that only read request.object
kyverno apply /tmp/policies.yaml --resource <fixture>.yaml

# policies that read the creating identity (restrict-*-operator-pod-labels,
# protect-operator-owned-labels) need a mocked userInfo offline:
kyverno apply /tmp/policies.yaml \
  --resource pods.yaml --userinfo userinfo.yaml
# where userinfo.yaml is:
#   apiVersion: cli.kyverno.io/v1alpha1
#   kind: UserInfo
#   userInfo:
#     username: system:serviceaccount:<ns>:strimzi-cluster-operator

# policies using an apiCall context (e.g. require-linkerd-sidecar reads the
# namespace annotation) need a live cluster to resolve the context:
kyverno apply /tmp/policies.yaml --cluster -n <ns>
```

## Protecting against NetworkPolicy label spoofing

The cluster's NetworkPolicies authorize traffic by the `app.kubernetes.io/name`
label (e.g. only pods labelled `apisix` may reach the data plane). Any actor
able to create a Pod with an arbitrary label can therefore impersonate another
workload and inherit its network reachability. Statically deployed workloads are
reviewed in CI (`.ci/policies`, rendered manifests), but **operators create Pods
dynamically at runtime** and bypass that review — so they are the main spoofing
risk. Two complementary controls, both keyed on the *creating identity*
(`request.userInfo`, admission-only — hence `background: false`):

- **Forward** (`restrict-*-operator-pod-labels`): an operator may only set
  `app.kubernetes.io/name` to its own components — it can't claim `portal`,
  `apisix`, etc. The SA name is extracted namespace-agnostically via
  `split(request.userInfo.username, ':') | [-1]`.
- **Reverse** (`protect-operator-owned-labels`): an operator-owned value
  (`kafka`, `postgresql`) may only be set by a Pod that operator created — any
  other creator claiming it is denied. This matches the operator's **full** SA
  username (`system:serviceaccount:<ns>:<name>`, namespace injected at render
  time from the operator's namespace), not just the trailing name, so a
  same-named SA in another namespace cannot be trusted.

> **Only Pods the operator creates *directly* can be reverse-protected.** The
> reverse check keys on `request.userInfo`, so it only works for values carried
> by Pods the operator's ServiceAccount creates itself — e.g. Kafka
> brokers/controllers, which Strimzi creates via a StrimziPodSet. **Deployment-
> managed** components (the Strimzi `entity-operator`, `kafka-exporter`,
> `cruise-control`, and the operators' *own* pods like `strimzi-kafka-operator` /
> `cloudnative-pg`) have their Pods created by kube-controller-manager's
> replicaset-controller, **not** the operator SA — so their values can never
> satisfy the check and must be left out of the reverse protected-value set to
> avoid an unavoidable false positive. The forward allowlists are unaffected

> **Note — protected values vs. actual NetworkPolicy selectors.** The reverse
