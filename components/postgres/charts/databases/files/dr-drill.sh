# The monthly restore drill (OPS-11, OPS-12, T-0046, T-5101). Restores $SOURCE twice into the
# throwaway Cluster $DRILL, one after the other: first the latest base backup and WAL, then a
# point in time, the instant the drill counted every table of the source. It compares row
# counts (per database for the latest, per table for the point in time), checks the realm and
# the Portal's schema in the copy, measures RTO and RPO, records the result and deletes the
# copy. With the nightly local dump on (LOCAL_BACKUP, T-5556) the pod's init container first runs
# this script as `dr-drill.sh dump`: it restores the newest dump into a Postgres of its own and
# compares its tables with the counts the dump job took. Every number in the result is read from
# the clusters; none is typed here.
