# viz

The chart renderer of [ADR-N-053](https://github.com/marek-mraz/joinedcontext-docs/blob/main/Decisions/adr-n-053-declarative-visualizations.md)
on `https://viz.{domain}/` (T-4641). An Endpoint lists Vega-Lite 5 or Vega 5 specs in
`spec.catalog.visualizations`; the reconciler publishes each as a CKAN resource view of type
`jc_visualization` (T-4642); the catalogue frames this host to draw it.

Two documents, two origins of trust:

- **The host page** (`/#{viewId}`, `files/site/index.html` and `host.js`). Our code, no spec
  runs here. It reads the view anonymously from CKAN's action API (`resource_view_show` on
  `opendata.{domain}`, which answers CORS for this origin alone), checks the spec against the
  refusal list (`refuse.js`), fetches the declared source of that Endpoint on `api.{domain}`
  without a token (`csv`, `ogc`, `odata` or `temporal`), stops at 15 seconds, 50,000 rows or
  20 MB, and posts spec and rows to the renderer. `&inline` hides its title, description and
  link (the dataset page shows them); `&lang=sk` names the language. Any site may frame it: it
  holds no secret, and the "Embed on a website" snippet is exactly that frame.
- **The renderer** (`/render.html`, `render.js`). Framed by the host page with
  `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-downloads"`, so it runs in an opaque origin and reads no cookie
  of any host. Its CSP allows no connection (`connect-src 'none'`) and no `eval`; it checks the
  spec again and draws it with `vega-embed`, `ast: true` and `vega-interpreter`, with a loader
  that refuses every load, and offers PNG and SVG export only.

- **`#show`** (ADR-N-053 §2.9, T-4657). The host page opened as `/#show` reads no view: the
  assistant's widget posts one `{"type": "jc-viz-show", "spec", "rows", "lang"}`, accepted only
  from `https://{domain}` or `https://*.{domain}`. A Vega spec goes to the renderer as above; a
  map spec (`"$schema": "urn:joinedcontext:map:v1"`, GeoJSON and a popup field list) goes to
  **the map page** (`/map.html`, `map.js`): MapLibre on `tiles.{domain}` (T-4638), CSP
  `connect-src https://tiles.{domain}` alone, every popup value set as text, Enter opens the
  feature nearest the middle.

- **The explorer** (`/explore.html#{slug}&inline&lang=sk&type=T`, `explore.js`, T-5059). The
  catalogue's dataset and resource pages frame it for every Endpoint: a table of the entities with
  paging (NGSI-LD `limit`/`offset`/`count`), search and per-attribute filters, a column picker, a
  detail dialog with the same query's NGSI-LD, OData, OGC and CSV addresses, and a map of the same
  query as GeoJSON within the map's view (at most 1000 a view). It reads `api.{domain}`
  anonymously and copies nothing. A filter becomes `q` only from the attribute names the Endpoint's
  `types?details=true` lists, with typed and escaped values (`buildQ`). Only the catalogue may
  frame it (`frame-ancestors https://opendata.{domain}`); it connects to the API and the tiles.
  The broker ignores `orderBy` today, so a column sorts the page on screen and says so.

The Vega, MapLibre 6.14.0 and pmtiles 4.5.0 builds are the npm releases byte for byte
(`images/viz/vendor/SHA256SUMS`), served from this host: no CDN. They are baked into the image
`ghcr.io/<owner>/joinedcontext-viz` (`images/viz/Dockerfile`, which checks the sums at build time;
built and signed by `.github/workflows/image-viz.yml`), because as chart files they took the Helm
release past the 1 MiB its Secret holds (T-4657). The image is pinned by digest in `images.yaml`.
MapLibre's two ES modules are stored gzipped, and nginx serves them as they are
(`gzip_static always`, `gunzip on`).

Tests: `tests/test_viz.py` (render, headers, checksums, and `node --test` on
`components/viz/tests/*.test.mjs`); the browser journey `components/viz/tests/journey.spec.mjs`
runs the good specs and the hostile ones with the hosts routed to these files, and
`explore.spec.mjs` runs the explorer over viewer, width, theme, language, data shape and failure,
leaving a screenshot of each state in `components/viz/tests/test-results/explore/`.
