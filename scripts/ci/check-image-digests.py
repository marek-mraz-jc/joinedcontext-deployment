A tag moves. An image pinned by `:main` is whatever the registry served the minute the kubelet
pulled it, which is not the image anybody reviewed, and a compromised registry needs no
signature to replace it. `components/*/images.yaml` is already held to this by
`scripts/airgap-inventory.py`; what this reads is the rendered output, where an upstream
chart's own default tag is the one that gets through.
