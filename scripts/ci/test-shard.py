"""The test files one ci.yml `tests` shard runs, balanced by measured time (T-4789).

usage: scripts/ci/test-shard.py <shard> <shards>          prints that shard's files (tests/<name>), one per line
       scripts/ci/test-shard.py --record <file>...         rewrites .ci/test-durations.json from the shards'
                                                           `pytest --junitxml` reports (or `--durations=0` logs)

Split by file position (line n in shard n mod 4), the heavy render and container files met in
one shard: shard 4 ran 13.6 min of pytest against 3-5.5 min for the others and passed the job's
15 minutes on three main runs of 2026-10-20. Here each file weighs its seconds in
.ci/test-durations.json and goes, heaviest first, to the shard with the least time so far
(longest processing time first); a file the table lacks weighs the median, so a new test file
still lands in exactly one shard. Shard 1 starts with SHARD_ONE_STEPS seconds, its extra steps
(gitleaks over the history, the docs pin, the kyverno apply).

The table went stale within days (T-5551: 73 of 271 files missing, shard 1 at 1,192 s of its 20
minutes against 544 s for shard 2), so every ci.yml shard uploads its junit report and the
`test-durations` job on main prints the table they add up to: commit it when the shards drift.

A file heavier than a quarter of one shard's share goes to every shard, and the conftest hook
`pytest_collection_modifyitems` keeps every count-th of its tests there (JC_TEST_SHARD=<shard>/<count>),
so no one file pins a shard (T-5886: test_smoke_script.py weighed 1,393 s of a 3,300 s share).
