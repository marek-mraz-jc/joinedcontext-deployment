# Egress: the other half of the same default-deny, and the half nothing measured until now.
# `podSelector: {}` with both policy types is what the repository renders
# (defaults/environment/networkpolicies.yaml.gotmpl), but a controller that enforces only
# ingress passes every check above while leaving a compromised pod free to call out — which
# is what happened on this cluster long enough for T-0258 to be written against it. The
# rendered manifest cannot tell the two apart: tests/test_networkpolicies.py asserts the same
# YAML either way, so the difference only exists on a running cluster (OPS-38, SEC-GAP-05).
#
# The probe prints one line per destination it reached and one line to prove it ran at all.
# Without that last line a pod that never started looks exactly like a pod the policy stopped,
# and this check would go quietly green the day the image or the namespace changes.
#
# It settles first. The controller programs a NEW pod's egress chains a few seconds after that
# pod is running, so a probe that calls out the instant it starts measures the gap and not the
# policy: measured here, the same pod spec reaches 1.1.1.1:443 immediately and is refused
# twenty-five seconds later. The loop waits for the refusal and reports how long it took, so a
# window that grows is visible rather than silent; if it never comes the measurement below
# runs anyway and fails, which is the case this check exists for. The window itself is real

# its address with its own host's certificate, and refuses a CONNECT without a token. Plain 1883
# is never reachable from outside. A broker is its Deployment and its host its Certificate's name
# (a custom hostname with the admin's certificate: its route's `HostSNI`). A broker with a
# dedicated port has only its `-port` route, which answers a client that sends no SNI with the same
# certificate (T-5856, T-5871); the others have the 8883 route by `HostSNI`. Certificate doors
# (`-cert`, T-5875) need a client certificate and are not probed here.
# The brokers live where the brokers chart put its `broker-template` (the instance's namespace on
# dev). Fewer running than the seed declares (gitea-seed-* ConfigMaps) fails; neither skips.
