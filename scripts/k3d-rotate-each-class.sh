# One rotation of each in-cluster credential class, on the deployment ci-full's k3d-deploy job
# has just smoke-tested (T-2843, OPS-45; Operations/01 Runbook 5). The harness runs it with
#
#   ./scripts/test-deployment-variants.sh --after ./scripts/k3d-rotate-each-class.sh 0,0,0
#
# and smoke-tests again afterwards. What only a running cluster proves: keycloak-config-cli
# re-imports a client whose one change is its secret, CloudNativePG applies a changed role
# password, helm makes a deleted Secret again, and every reader comes back healthy.
# rotate-secret.sh measures each one: the old value refused, the new one accepted.
#
# Never against dev without an announcement in AI_shared_folder.md: a rotation restarts the
# Portal.
