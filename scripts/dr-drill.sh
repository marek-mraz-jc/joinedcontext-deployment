# The restore half of the disaster recovery drill (OPS-11, OPS-12, CC-50, T-0046).
#
# The deployment half is not here: the k3d lane of `ci-full` already brings a whole instance up
# with `scripts/test-deployment-variants.sh`, and duplicating that would be a second harness to
# keep in step with the first. This script is what happens to an instance that is already
# running, in the order Runbook 6 and `Deployment/07 §3` give it:
#
#   1. back the database up into the object store the instance carries,
#   2. lose the database, the way an incident loses it,
#   3. bring it back from the archive at an instant inside the retention window (OPS-10),
#   4. replay the repository's seed entities through the gateway (CC-72), and
#   5. assert the platform holds what Git declares, by asking `jcctl plan` for a diff.
#
# A drill that only proves step 3 proves the database came back. The point of 4 and 5 is that
# the *platform* came back: the manifests are read from Git by every component, and the seed
# entities are the one state the repository cannot project by itself.
#
#   scripts/dr-drill.sh --check                 # preconditions only, changes nothing
#   scripts/dr-drill.sh --env local --slug local
#
# Every step prints what it runs. `--check` is what CI runs before the cluster exists and what
# an operator runs against a live instance to see whether a drill would work there — it reads
# and asserts, and writes nothing.
