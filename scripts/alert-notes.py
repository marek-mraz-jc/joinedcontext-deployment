"""Alertmanager's alerts as one note line each, for the deployer (T-5104).

Reads `GET /api/v2/alerts` of Alertmanager on stdin (the cluster-watch host job fetches it with
`kubectl get --raw /api/v1/namespaces/<ns>/services/alertmanager-operated:9093/proxy/api/v2/alerts`)
and the state file of the previous run, prints one line per alert that started or resolved since,
and rewrites the state file. The job sends each line through `tasks/note "@deployer ..."`.

A line carries the alert's name, its severity, its summary and only the labels in KEEP: hosts,
surfaces, Endpoints, projects, pipelines, volumes, nodes. Nothing else from a series reaches a
note, so a label a future exporter adds (a user, a client address) never leaves the cluster.
