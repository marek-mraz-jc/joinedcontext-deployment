"""Prepare the rendered manifests for the credential scan.

`helm template` runs the in-cluster secret generator without a cluster, so every
render invents fresh random passwords. They are throwaway (on apply the generator
reuses the live Secret), and scanning them only produces noise, so their values are
redacted here. Everything else — including Secrets shipped by third-party charts —
reaches gitleaks unchanged, and a hand-written `stringData:` block fails outright:
that is a plaintext credential inside a manifest.
