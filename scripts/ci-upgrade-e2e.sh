# `just upgrade` end to end (T-3997, T-3794), what ci-full's `upgrade` job runs:
#
#   1. the previous release tag (the newest `v*` below HEAD) is installed into a fresh k3d cluster
#      by its own harness (the 0,0,0 variant k3d-deploy runs: one namespace, no mesh), kept up;
#   2. HEAD becomes a pre-release `v<next patch>-ci.<run>`: its notes written, committed and tagged
#      in this checkout only, never pushed;
#   3. every CloudNativePG cluster gets a backup to an S3 store beside the k3d nodes, so the
#      upgrade takes a real one rather than being waved through by --i-have-a-backup;
#   4. `just upgrade` to that tag must end green and write it into the ConfigMap jc-release;
#   5. the same upgrade again against a domain no smoke can reach must end red, every release it
#      advanced must be rolled back to the revision it had, nothing may be deleted, and jc-release
#      must still name the green run's version.
#
# Needs docker, k3d, helmfile, helm, kubectl, just and python3 with PyYAML. Exit 0 when all five
# hold. The cluster and the store stay up on failure, for the job's diagnostics step.
