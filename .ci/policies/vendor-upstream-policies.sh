# components/runtime-policies, so admission and CI judge the same file (T-0008).
# require-drop-all rather than disallow-capabilities-strict on purpose: the strict policy
# also forbids adding capabilities, and Linkerd's linkerd-init adds NET_ADMIN and NET_RAW to
# program the pod's iptables, so at admission it would reject every meshed pod. Rendered
# manifests carry no such init container, which is why CI can hold the stricter line.
