"""What the Portal has to trust to finish OIDC discovery (T-0350).

`JC_OIDC_ISSUER` is the public host, because the `iss` claim of every token carries it. Under
the self-signed cluster issuer that host is served with the cluster CA, and the Portal binary
carries the Mozilla bundle alone: discovery dies at the handshake and the pod exits before it
serves anything. The render is the only place this is decidable, so it is the only place a test
can catch it before a variant run spends ten minutes discovering the same thing.
