"""The edge attack surface: what a request from the internet may set, reach and cost.

Five attack vectors, played against the edge configuration rather than against a cluster:

* **T-1672 (GW12, AG-38)** a header the edge should own arrives from outside;
* **T-1673 (OPS-31)** a route without the authentication its sibling has;
* **T-1674 (OPS-27)** TLS, HSTS and the security headers on every host;
* **T-1675 (GW26)** request smuggling and oversized requests;
* **T-1676 (OPS-31)** the admin surfaces are reachable from the internet.

The live half of each vector — actually sending the header, the 1 GB body, the probe for
the Admin API — is `joinedcontext-conformance/tests/security/test_edge_hardening.py`,
which runs against a throwaway environment and never against dev.

Why these walk `components/*/apisix-{routes,plugins}.yaml` and not only a render: a render
carries the components that one environment lists, and every edge test before this one read
the `local` render alone. CKAN is in `dev` and Grafana in `addons`, so neither has ever been
walked by an edge test — and `ckan-redirect` shipped with no header sanitisation and none of
the response headers its sibling `portal-redirect` carries. A route is checked here on the
day it is written, whether or not the one rendered environment switches its component on.
