"""T-5056, DM-132: history is opt-in (the broker runs ANTARES_TEMPORAL_RECORD=ruled), so a seeded retention rule says what it
keeps: a duration, `forever` or `off`. A rule that names a type without `history` would record nothing and read as if it
kept something; a type no rule names records nothing at all.
