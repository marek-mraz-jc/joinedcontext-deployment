"""The CKAN table view shows every DataStore column with its values (T-3047).

A published endpoint's DataStore columns are named after their NGSI-LD paths
(`dataProvider.value`, `location.value.coordinates`). CKAN 2.11's datatables_view gave
DataTables that name as the column's `data`, which DataTables reads as nested-object notation:
every such column rendered empty and a person saw only `_id`, `entity_id` and `type`. The
catalogue image rewrites the accessor to a function; these tests run the image's own RUN line on
the upstream source line and on a source where upgrade moved it.
