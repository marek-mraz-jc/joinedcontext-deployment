"""Attack vector: password guessing and the demo accounts in production (T-1680, PF-46).

The attack, in three moves:

1. a thousand passwords against one account,
2. one password against a thousand account names,
3. the demo people and the bootstrap administrator, tried with the credentials whoever
   reads `DEMO.md` already knows.

Every defence against the three is realm configuration or edge configuration, so every
assertion here reads the rendered deployment and needs no running system: the suite is part
of the fast lane and is replayed on every commit rather than on a cluster somebody remembers
to point it at.

What the file does *not* claim: that a second factor is required of an administrator. It is
offered and prompted for whoever enrolled one, which is what
`test_an_administrator_who_enrolled_a_second_factor_is_always_asked_for_it` asserts. Making it
mandatory is T-2351.
