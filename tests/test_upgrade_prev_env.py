"""T-4784: the upgrade job's starting environment, rebuilt from the previous release's harness.

`scripts/test-deployment-variants.sh` removes its generated scratch environment on exit, with
--keep too, so ci-full 39335432708 failed copying `environments/testing` out of the previous
release's worktree. `scripts/prev-env-overlay.sh` writes it again with that harness's own
write_env_overlay.
