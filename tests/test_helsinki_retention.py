"""T-3904: the helsinki space keeps its transport data under retention and quality rules.

The values are the owner's (DM-81, DM-86, ADR-N-046): a vehicle is gone five minutes after its
last report and keeps five minutes of track (owner, T-5046; an hour before, T-4624); positions lie in what
HSL's feeds cover, speeds up to 160 km/h (the Sm5 commuter trains), and no report is ahead of the clock. Beside the
vehicle only an Alert loses its current state, an hour after its last write, as the net for a writer that sets no end
and for the Fintraffic Alerts written before their mapping gave each one (T-4843); no other type of the seed does.
