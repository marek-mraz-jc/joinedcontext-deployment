"""T-4275: every type a seeded space declares states its history, off or kept for a while.

The owner's defaults (DM-82, ADR-N-046 2.3): a measurement series keeps 30 days of history, every
other type keeps its current state only; the seed never keeps a history forever. A space's model
is its whole list of types (DM-61), so a type without a rule would keep everything it is sent.
