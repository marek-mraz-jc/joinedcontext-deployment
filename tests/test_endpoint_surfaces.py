"""T-4319: every Endpoint a project repository holds serves MCP, and OGC API Features when its
space holds located entities (owner 2026-10-16: "NGSI-LD, MCP, and OGC API where the data has a
location"). The audience and the Policy still decide who may call each surface.

The manifests are the ones the forge is seeded with: the projects' own (components/context-
gateway/seed) and the sample Apps' generated Endpoints (components/gitea/apps). Live residue an
e2e run leaves in a forge repository is not in either and is not judged here.
