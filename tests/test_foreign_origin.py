"""Attack vector: a write without the CSRF token, or from another origin (T-1679, PF-46).

The CSRF half of the vector is played where the gate lives, in the Portal:
`joinedcontext-portal/tests/edge_auth_csrf_tests.rs` sends every mutating route with the
session cookie and no token, with a wrong token, with a token from another cookie name and
with a byte that differs, and proves the gate sits in front of every mutating API route and of
no read. Nothing of that is repeated here.

This file is the other half — the origin — and it lives in the deployment repository because
that is where the answer is decided. Two rules together:

* the Portal's own routes carry no `cors` plugin at all, so a page on another origin gets no
  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and the browser never lets it read the response, whatever the
  CSRF gate would have said;
* the endpoint surface, which is meant to be read by browser apps, names the origins it
  allows by a regular expression and allows no credentials with them.

A regular expression is where this goes wrong quietly: `^https://.+\\.platform.example.org$`
reads as "a subdomain of ours" and means "a subdomain of anything that looks like ours,
because `.` matches every character" — `https://evil.platform-example.org` is a host somebody
else can register, and it matched. The escaping is now done by the ConfigMap template
(`${DOMAIN_RE}`), and `test_a_look_alike_domain_is_not_our_domain` is what keeps it done.
